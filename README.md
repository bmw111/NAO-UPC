NAO-UPC
=======

Repository for nao code development. The goal is to develop 3 tests:

* Put off the fire: the robot must check which kitchen fire is lit, and put it off by pressing the corresponding button.

* Shopping list: the robot must recognize which products (from a pre-defined set) are available on the shelves, and which other products are missing, and make a shopping-list.

* Meal preparation: the robot must grasp a tomato and put it into a cooking pan.
